Generic Backrooms is my first mod, which I'm using to learn how to add blocks, items, room based generation (Does this count as world generation?), and maybe entities if I get around to it.

There isn't much right now, but I do want to finish this at some point.

I have zero clue what I'm doing, so please be patient if I act stupid!
